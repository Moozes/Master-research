Ai
    overview
        after breaking the Enigma machine that was made by the Nazies for secure/encrypted communications in world war against the alies, Alan Turing once again changed the course of history by asking the following question "Can machines think?" in a paper he published in 1950 titled "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", this question is what gave rise to Artificial Intelligence, because all what artificial intelligence is trying to do is answer that question in the affirmative by trying to mimic human intelligence in machines [ref1] to do so Turing has put forward a test called "The Turing Test" which will be explained later , now because artificial intelligence is a concept that is  so broad and general people dont always agree on a definition, but we found that the below definition is a good enough explanation.
    definition
        "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence." [ref1]
    turing test
        it is basically a test put forward by the mathematician Alan Turing to determin whether a machine is intteligent or not, the test goes as follows, "If a machine can engage in a conversation with a human without being detected as a machine, it has demonstrated human intelligence." [ref4]
    
    the 4 types of Artificial Intelligence
        Reactive Machines
            it is one of the most basic form of artificial intelligence because as the title suggests it only reacts to its surrounding environment, and does not use a memory to try and learn from past experience so it is purely reactive which means that this type of artificial intelligence can only be responsible for a very narrow and spepcialised set of tasks, this narrowness can be looked at as a limitation but in fact it is what makes it special in being very trust worthy and error free. a famous example of this type would be the chess playing machine Deep Blue made by IBM in the 1990's which treats each move in the game as it own seperate reality and doesnt rely on past moves [ref1]
        Limited Memory
            it is a type of artificial intelligence that relies on memory and automatic training , which means learning from past experience to try to make optimised decisions/predictions, the learning steps in this type can be looked at as a feedback loop (generate data, learn, make model, make predictions, accept feedback), there are 3 major models that utilise this type [ref1]: 
                Reinforcement learning
                    learning from trial and error
                Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
                    uses past data to make predictions, the more recent the data the more weight it has on making predictions
                Evolutionary Generative Adversarial Networks (E-GAN)
                    this model grows constantly by putting 2 machines against each other and they learn by bouncing information off of each other. 
        Theory of Mind
            this is purely theoretical and technology is still not caught up to this, and it stipulates that machines would be able to understand how humans and animals think and feel and make decisions throught self reflection [ref1].
        Self-awareness
            after Theory of Mind is established this is the next step, where machines bacome self aware and comprehensive of its own existence by obtaining human level intelligence and consciousness [ref1].
    
    Artificial Intelligence Categories
        generally speaking there are 2 categories of artificial intelligence [ref1]
            Narrow artificial intelligence
                also know as "Weak artificial intelligence", it operates in a limited context and is often specialised in a single task such as : Google Search, Image Recognition, Self-Driving Cars...etc
            artificial general intelligence
                also know as "Strong artificial intelligence", it is the kind of artificial intelligence we see in Science Fiction movies implimented in robots that have human level intelligence and that can apply its intelligence to solve any problem.
Machine Learning
    overview
        machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that has a human like ability to learn from past experience through statistics and data and it has helped us solve difficult world problems ranging from medical problems to environmental issues, and the special thing about machine learning is its ability to solve these problems wthout being explicitly programmed to do so with the usual sequence of code lines that define normal (non artificial intelligence ) algorithms, but it relies on tacit knowledge (past experience) to try and find patterns and make predictions, humans use tacit knowledge all the time for example a person cant accuratly explain how he preforms face recognition but it is gained through the experience of observing that face numerous times in different angles and states[ref2]
    definition
        "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that gives systems the ability to learn and optimize processes without having to be consistently programmed. Simply put, machine learning uses data, statistics and trial and error to “learn” a specific task without ever having to be specifically coded for the task."[ref2]
    types of machine learning algorithms
        Supervised Learning
            supervised machine learning algorithms provide a mathematical model that can make the connection between inputs and outputs of the training data (pre-labeled data) in the most optimised way so that when it is provided with new data it can make vary accurate predictions. regression and classification are the most popular supervised algorithms 
        Unsupervised Learning
            Unsupervised algorithms take unlabeled input data and try to structure it in the form of clustering or grouping by taking into account commonaities or lack of commonaities.
        Semi-Supervised Learning
            this types falls in the middle, it is given labeled and unlabeled data with unlabeled being the bigger percentage then the algorithm is going to cluster the unlabeled data throught the structure of the labeled data which offers a huge optimisation for both sides, because supervised learning requires a huge size of labeled data which is usualy done by human beings which means that it takes alot of time and is bound to human error, and Unsupervised learnning algorithms takes alot of time also figuring out the connections in the raw unlabeled data.
