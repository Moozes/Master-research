a cancer cell may originate almost from every organ cell in the human body 
they are not very different from there origin cell
so instead of studying the differences between cancer cells and there origin cells we should on the contrary study there similarities which will improve diagnostics and treatement methods
origin cell provide a roadmap to study the cancer cell
divide uncontrollably and spread to other organs 
caused by your own cells in contrast to other diseases which are cause by a foreign entity

origin of cancer 
carcinogenesis multi hit theory 
which stipulates that for a cancer to emerge there are some conditions (hits) that need to be satisfied
these hits are produced by genetic mutations or rearrangments that occurs over many years and the nember of hits necessary is minimal ranging from 3 to 7 only. but it is only fair to mention that there are some exceptions to the rule as there are some cancers caused by only one hit.
