cancer causes big deaths
some therapies are hormones, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy with side effects deterierate
new methods stem cells 

cancer is one of the biggest causes of death among humans nowadays and that is 
because of the ineffectivenes of traditional treatment methods like 1,2,3,4
there ineffectivenes is due to there side effects that lead the body to deteriarate more and more
but there are some new methods that researchers are studying and developping such as the use of stem cells which looks more hopefull

---from me----
agreement point, best treatement is early dicovery of the cancer before it spreads and  develops into more serious fazes
