skin cancer detection and classification using machine learning
3.proposed methodology
    the proposed methodology in this article uses a 6 step process (input data -> preprocessing -> segmentation -> feature extraction -> classification -> output data)

    input data 
        dermoscopic images from the ISIC ( International Skin Imaging Collaboration) 2019 challenge containing 8 classes of skin cancer, and for simplisity reasons only 800 images out of 25000 is used.
    
    preprocessing
        because of the heteroginity of the input data a preprocessing step is required to inhance the quality of images and remove irrelevant parts. the main technices used here are gray scale conversion and the application of the Gaussian and median filter for noise removal and enhancement, and for the unwanted hair they applied the Dull Razor method (a preprocessing algorithm) [fig preprocessing.png (a)Dull razor image, (b) Gray scale image, (c) Gaussian filter, (d) Median filter.]

    segmentation
        segmnetation is used to extract the region of interest and for that they used a k-means clustering algorithm [fig segmentation.png (a) Image labelled by cluster index, (b) Objects in cluster 1, (c) Objects in cluster 2, (d) Objects in cluster 3.]
        
    feature extraction
        for this they used 2 well know methods, ABCD method and GLCM. ABCD is used in dermatological applications and diagnosis for skin lesions such as melanomas and it is the abreviation of Asymmetry, Border, Color and Diameter. Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is used for texture analysis, other features are also used in addition to these 2 methods for further classification such as Autocorrelation, correlation, Standard vector...etc
    
    classification
        for classification they used MSVM (Multi-class Support vector machine) machine learning algorithm, they used trainning and testing ratios of 70:30 and obtained an acuuracy of 96.25% and the confusion matrix shown in figure [fig confusion-matrix.png]

Finding reduced Raman spectroscopy fingerprint of skin samples for melanoma diagnosis through machine learning
1.introduction
    this article uses a new non invasive approach to classify malignant and benign tumors, and that is by using Raman spectral data instead of images, Raman Spectroscopy is a way to analyse the chemical structure using light and vibrational energy modes of molecules [https://www.edinst.com/blog/what-is-raman-spectroscopy/]

data and method 
    dataset
    for the dataset they brought 33 benign and 51 malignant smaples and cut them into regular cuts of 2mm³, a layser was used to excite the samples to collect the Raman signals using special tools after this they aquired 436 Raman spectra. and they focused on the biological fibgerprint spectral region from 800 to 1800 cm⁻¹

    Fluorescence background data pre-process
    Fluorescence is a radiation that is emitted by molecules after interacting with electromagnetic radiation and this could overshdow and disturb the study of Raman spectra, to deal with this noise they used a low frequency laser to lower the probability of fluorescence emissions and by this they could jump the preprocessing step.

feature extraction
    they divided the obtained spectrums into subsequences (local spectrums) and extracted some statistical measures from it such as arithmetic mean, standard deviation, derivative ...etc

results and discussion
    these statistical features were then given to a machine learning classification algorithm, a complex dicision tree impimented using lightGBM (open source software), other algorithms were also used such as K-nearest neighbors and XGBOOST (Extreme Gradient Boosting an open source software) but the best performance was obtained using lightGBM.
    further research led them to only use the derivative as a feature and a spectral region from 896 to 1039 cm⁻¹ because these two were proved the most discriminative information between malignant and benign tumors and by this they obtained a high performant model (AUC >= 0.97) shown in figure [ROC.ong]
