Abstract: Skin cancer is considered as one of the most dangerous types of cancers and there is a drastic increase in the rate of deaths due to lack of knowledge on the symptoms and their prevention. Thus, early detection at premature stage is necessary so that one can prevent the spreading of cancer. Skin cancer is further divided into various types out of which the most hazardous ones are Melanoma, Basal cell carcinoma and Squamous cell carcinoma. This project is about detection and classification of various types of skin cancer using machine learning and image processing tools. In the pre-processing stage, dermoscopic images are considered as input. Dull razor method is used to remove all the unwanted hair particles on the skin lesion, then Gaussian filter is used for image smoothing. For noise filtering and to preserve the edges of the lesion, Median filter is used. Since color is an important feature in analyzing the type of cancer, color-based k-means clustering is performed in segmentation phase. The statistical and texture feature extraction is implemented using Asymmetry, Border, Color, Diameter, (ABCD) and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). The experimental analysis is conduted on ISIC 2019 Challenge dataset consisting of 8 different types of dermoscopic images. For classification purpose, Multi-class Support Vector Machine (MSVM) was implemented and the accuracy obtained is about 96.25.
