That is why an early diagnosis will save your life. Here where the CAD's (computer aided diagnosis) systems would play an important role by implementing machine learning algorithms that could recognize, detect and classify various skin lesions. Advancements in both machine learning and deep learning have produced a lot of models that reach an accuracy above that of an expert dermatologist, but we can't do without the expertise of specialized doctors.

In this article we have presented a diagnosis system that could facilitate the process of detection and early discovery of melanoma skin cancer, it is web-based, easy to use and accessible to everyone, all you need is internet connection, a laptop or a smartphone, and you are set to go.
