skin
    definition
        ref1
        the skin is a complex organ and it is composed of several cell populations, 

        ref2
        it is interactive, self renewing and represents the primary and first defense line against hostile environment and it has severla characteristics such as selective absoption, auto regeneration when injured, barrier to water loss and pathogens, protection against various types of radiations, touch sensitivity, temperature regulation ...etc

        ref3 
        it represents the body largest sensory organ, and it has a highly adaptive structure that makes it vital for the survival of the human body
        total area of 20 square feet
        15% of total body weight

        ref4 
        the balance between its static and dynamic properties makes it highly adaptive the variations of the outer world

        the skin is a complex organ a[ref1], it is interactive, self renewing and represents the first and primary defense line against hostile environment and it has several characteristics such as selective absoption, auto regeneration when injured, barrier to water loss, touch sensitivity ...etc[ref2]. It represents the largest sensory organ (15% of total body weight and a total area of 1.86 m²)[ref3], it has a highly adaptive structure that makes it vital for the survival of the human body, the balance between its static and dynamic properties makes it highly adaptive to the variations of the outer world[ref4].

    structure
        the skin is primary composed of 3 main layers, each layer has its unique properties and functions [ref3].
        1epidermis
            the outer most layer which is constantly regenerating and it contains the pigment melanin that determins the skin color and it also represents a physical and biological barrier
        2dermis
            the middle layer, it supports the flexibility and gives strength the epidermis and it is maily composed of connective tissue

        3hypodermis
            the last layer which is composed of subcutaneous fat which gives it its properties of being a main support of the overall structure of the skin and shock absoption

        hair
            provides protection agains minor trauma, thermoregulation and filtering functions such as nasal hair and eyelashes

        sweat glands
            it is foucd across the entire body, it provides lubrication, temprerature regulation and salt and water balance.

    functions
        this skin has 6 main functions that can be summarized as follows[ref3]
        protection
            the skin is a direct interface between the entarnal organs and the environment so it works as a protective barrier against harmful objects and pathogens (innate/adaptive immunity and unltra-violet light protection [ref2])
            ----------figure skin protective barrier-------------
        thermostat
            the skin works as a thermoregulator to keep the body at the optimal temperature of 37 C°, to achieve that is uses multiple strategies such as insensible perspiration, sweating ...etc
        neural relay network
            the skin contains a dense network of neural endings that works as receptors to various signals and provides sensations for touch, temperature and pain.
        expression and communication
            A more social function
            is the ability for skin to enable individuals to display
            emotions. It acts as an indicator of one’s physical state.
            Skin is an important component of the stress response as it
            acts as an immediate stress perceiver and as a target of
            stress responses.
            the skin also works as a social tool for interactions between human beings by indicatings the physical state of the individual and by showing sign of stress.
        water storage
            this skin works as a conservative barrier agains water and body fluids leakage (18-20% of totla body water)
        Synthesis of vitamin D
            the skin reperesents the main site of vitamin D production when exposed to the sun, it exists in the plasma membranes of basal and suprabasal keratinocytes in its inactive form then it is converted to previtamin D3 then to Vitamin D in the liver and kidneys [ref2]
