there are 3 comparative article i can use
create table (something like this)
    algo dataset result limitation
    algo dataset results
    best algos using KPI-accuracy
    utilization shares of ML/DL
        ml 54\% dl 46\%




i can do a table to compare mesures of my state of the art



in this section we are going to present a comprehensive comparative information for the various methods tested on benchmark datasets and there evaluation metrics

ResNet/ Hallym dataset 19,398 instances are used & For Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)/ 96\% for asian dataset/ 90\% for the instances of caucasianFor Melanoma –/ 96\% for the instance of asian/ 88\% for caucasian dataset & Model performance depends on patient ethnicity

---

Whale algorithm applied to optimize the CNN model/ Around 22,000 images of Dermquest and DermIS dataset were used & Achieved :/ Specificity 98\%/ Accuracy- 94\%/ Sensitivity-97\%/ PPV-90\% & Results are unsatisfactory for non–Melanoma cases

---

ResNet/ Clinical images/ Clinical data are included & Achieved :/ 67.1\% for clinical images/ 78.8\% for clinical data and images & Missing values are not handled in clinical data/ Biopsy images are not included

---

ResNet/ 1279 dermoscopic instances are used & Achieved 89.2\% for ResNet without dermatologist/ 94.3\% for ResNet- with dermatologist & Clinical information to be included/ No standard evaluation criteria exist to measure classification efficacy

---


ResNet/ HAM10000 dataset, ISIC archive- 11,444 dermatoscopic instances are used & Mean accuracy of/ Physician 42.94/ CNN model – 81.59/ Fusion model – 82.59 & Model outperformed for the trained dataset, but performance degraded for other datasets.

---

ResNet/ Dermnet dataset provides an instance of 23 categories of skin diseases & Achieved 97.1\% & Able to identify few skin disease like/ Acne , Rosacea, Hemangioma,/ Psoriasis, Seborrheic Dermatitis

---

Dragonfly optimized DNN model is assessed using existing techniques such as Support Vector Machine, ANN, and to display the efficiency of the system diverse evaluation criteria’s are accuracy,sensitivity, and specificity are considered & Achieved/ Sensitivity – 84\%/ Specificity- 99.5\%/ Accuracy – 98.5\% & Result generated for Melanoma is inadequate

---

CNN model used to Categorized the skin cancer into Melanoma, nevi, basal cell carcinoma/ 11,444 dermoscopic images HAM10000 dataset, ISIC archive was used & 89.2\% of specificity and 56.5\% of sensitivity attained by the dermatologists/ Whereas the CNN model achieved 98.8\%. of sensitivity,and specificity & Model biased and failed to classify skin lesion properly/ For melanoma images CNN model diagnosed it as nevi whereas dermatologists diagnosed it as melanoma/ model achieved the lowest specificity 94.2\% for melanoma class

---

GoogleNet CNN model/ 4800 clinical images & Achieved/ Sensitivity 96.3\% Specificity 59.5\% & Model behaviour depends on skin colour tone, and Model biased, sensitivity and specificity dropped for Caucasian patients/ No standard evaluation criteria exist to measure classification efficacy

---

DenseNet, ResNet model results compared with Dermatologist/ 10,135 dermoscopy images of HAM10000: 10015, PH2: 120 data sets are used & For Melanoma and BCC – achieved94.40\% for ResNet, 99.30\% for DenseNet whereas Dermatologist achieved – 82.26\% and 88.82\% accuracy & Model biased for the diverse dataset/ Model behaviour depends on skin tone colour
