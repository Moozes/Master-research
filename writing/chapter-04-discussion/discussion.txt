i can do a table to compare mesures of my state of the art

dermoscopic images ISIC
raman spectral data, Fluorescence background data problem

some methods are none invasive some are, like the ones that take biobsies and micrscopic images

machine learning need way less data then deep learning 

msvm can classify 8 lesions with great accuracy

you dont need to be a programmer to build deep learning algorithm (deep learning studio) AUC of 99%, automatic REST API, cloud hosting

using hybrid data may create an imbalance like images with clinical info (categorical data: non numerical)

hybrid data need alot of preprocessing to standardize them because of there differences such as format size shape 

high quality of dermoscopic images over normal images

multiple algoritms to remove haire Maximum Gradient Intensity (MGI), Dull Razor method

look at computaion power and resources you have, high resolution images

labeling is a pain, some times need experts in a domain 

interpretability : deep algorithms defeated machine learning algorithms
interpretability : increases the chance of application in real world scenarios



article 1
    800 dermoscopic images ISIC of 8 lesion
    preprocessing
    segmentation
    feature extraction
    classification MSVM accuracy 96.25%

article 2
    436 Raman spectra (x:frequency, y:intensity of scattered light) for benign and malignant
    preprocessing of Fluorescence noise (ignoring for small frequencies of lazer)
    statistical features extracted from graphs
    classification lightGBM (complex dicision tree) AUC > 97% probability to differentiate between classes

article 3
    Kaggle image datasets
    some preprocessing
    CNN famous architectures (drag and drop) AUC 99%

article 4
    image (1612 image of 6 lesions)+ clinical info 
    imbalanced data ==> transfer learning + augmentation + one-hot encoding for clinical info (8 features to 28 values) and NN feature reducer for images features
    classification multiple CNN architectures AUC 95.8% and clinical added a 7% to almost all performance metrics

article 5
    hybrid features ABCD, GLCM, LBP from dermoscopic  ISIC+PH2 datasets (1940 benign + 1448 malignant)
    preprocessing 
    segmentation to keep only ROI
    hybrid features ABCD, GLCM, LBP
    classification 0 1 ANN, performance mesures all > 97%, effect of each feature > 69%

article 6
    interpretability by statistics or analyse the same way a doctor would
    dataset micrscopic images high resolution
    some preprocessing like adding white padding
    segmentation 12 classes CNN (U-net, Resnet)  85% accuracy
    classification CNN 4 healty and 3 lesions 93.6% accuracy (Random Forest 87.2%, KNN 80.9%, Single-layer Perceptron 85.1%)
