dermoscopic images ISIC
raman spectral data, Fluorescence background data problem

some methods are none invasive some are, like the ones that take biobsies and micrscopic images

machine learning need way less data then deep learning 

msvm can classify 8 lesions with great accuracy

you dont need to be a programmer to build deep learning algorithm (deep learning studio) AUC of 99%

using hybrid data may create an imbalance like images with clinical info (categorical data: non numerical)

hybrid data need alot of preprocessing to standardize them because of there differences such as format size shape 

high quality of dermoscopic images over normal images

multiple algoritms to remove haire Maximum Gradient Intensity (MGI), Dull Razor method


article 1
    800 dermoscopic images ISIC of 8 lesion
    preprocessing
    segmentation
    feature extraction
    classification MSVM accuracy 96.25%

article 2
    436 Raman spectra (x:frequency, y:intensity of scattered light) for benign and malignant
    preprocessing of Fluorescence noise (ignoring for small frequencies of lazer)
    statistical features extracted from graphs
    classification lightGBM (complex dicision tree) AUC > 97% probability to differentiate between classes

article 3
    Kaggle image datasets
    some preprocessing
    CNN famous architectures (drag and drop) AUC 99%

article 4
    image (1612 image of 6 lesions)+ clinical info 
    imbalanced data ==> transfer learning + augmentation + one-hot encoding for clinical info (8 features to 28 values) and NN feature reducer for images features
    classification multiple CNN architectures AUC 95.8% and clinical added a 7% to almost all performance metrics
