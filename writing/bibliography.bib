Objective: To build deep learning models to classify dermal cell images and detect skin cancer. Methods: A model-driven architecture in the cloud, that uses deep learning algorithms in its core implementations, is used to construct models that assist in predicting skin cancer with improved accuracy. The study illustrates the method of building models and applying them to classify dermal cell images. Results: The deep learning models built here are tested on standard datasets, and the metric area under the curve of 99.77% was observed. Conclusions: A practitioner can use the model-driven architecture and quickly build the deep learning models to predict skin cancer.},

As these three cancer types constitute more than 90% of diagnoses, we demonstrate that the majority of dermatopathology work is amenable to automatic machine analysis. A major feature of this work is characterising the tissue by classifying it into 12 meaningful dermatological classes, including hair follicles, sweat glands as well as identifying the well-defined stratified layers of the skin. These provide highly interpretable outputs as the network is trained to represent the problem domain in the same way a pathologist would. While this enables a high accuracy of whole image classification (93.6-97.9%), by characterising the full context of the tissue we can also work towards performing routine pathologist tasks, for instance, orientating sections and automatically assessing and measuring surgical margins. This work seeks to inform ways in which future computer aided diagnosis systems could be applied usefully in a clinical setting with human interpretable outcomes.},

   abstract = {Melanoma being the most unpredictable and life-threating cancer, has been on the rise in recent times. In most of the cases being fatal, if treated early, the fatality rate might be lowered severely. Hands-on Melanoma detection at primary stages with the unassisted eye is error-prone and requires vast knowledge and experience. Number of expert dermatologists being inadequate, a computerized and automated approach is needed to accurately detect Melanoma. The following study tries to achieve this feat by developing a neural network that can effectively detect and classify Melanoma. The process begins with preprocessing of dermoscopic images to remove hairs with the Maximum Gradient Intensity algorithm and also enhancement of the images is done. Segmentation based on Otsu Thresholding algorithm is applied to separate skin lesions from the images. Multiple features like ABCD, GLCM, and LBP are then calculated from the segmented images which will be used to train a neural network. The network was successful to attain an accuracy of 97.7% on the combined dataset of ISIC archive the PH2 dermoscopic image database. The proposed method was found to be more accurate than existing methods and encorporates much more feature information from the images.},

   abstract = {Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. Over the past few years, different approaches have been proposed to deal with automated skin cancer detection. Nonetheless, most of them are based only on dermoscopic images and do not take into account the patient clinical information, an important clue towards clinical diagnosis. In this work, we present an approach to fill this gap. First, we introduce a new dataset composed of clinical images, collected using smartphones, and clinical data related to the patient. Next, we propose a straightforward method that includes an aggregation mechanism in well-known deep learning models to combine features from images and clinical data. Last, we carry out experiments to compare the models’ performance with and without using this mechanism. The results present an improvement of approximately 7% in balanced accuracy when the aggregation method is applied. Overall, the impact of clinical data on models’ performance is significant and shows the importance of including these features on automated skin cancer detection.},

Excision biopsy followed by histological examination is considered the gold standard for diagnosing the disease, but requires long high-cost processing time, and may be biased, as it involves qualitative assessment by a professional. In this paper, we present a new machine learning approach using raw data for skin Raman spectra as input. The approach is highly efficient for classifying benign versus malignant skin lesions (AUC 0.98, 95% CI 0.97–0.99). Furthermore, we present a high-performance model (AUC 0.97, 95% CI 0.95–0.98) using a miniaturized spectral range (896–1039 cm−1), thus demonstrating that only a single fragment of the biological fingerprint Raman region is needed for producing an accurate diagnosis. These findings could favor the future development of a cheaper and dedicated Raman spectrometer for fast and accurate cancer diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Skin cancer is considered as one of the most dangerous types of cancers and there is a drastic increase in the rate of deaths due to lack of knowledge on the symptoms and their prevention. Thus, early detection at premature stage is necessary so that one can prevent the spreading of cancer. Skin cancer is further divided into various types out of which the most hazardous ones are Melanoma, Basal cell carcinoma and Squamous cell carcinoma. This project is about detection and classification of various types of skin cancer using machine learning and image processing tools. In the pre-processing stage, dermoscopic images are considered as input. Dull razor method is used to remove all the unwanted hair particles on the skin lesion, then Gaussian filter is used for image smoothing. For noise filtering and to preserve the edges of the lesion, Median filter is used. Since color is an important feature in analyzing the type of cancer, color-based k-means clustering is performed in segmentation phase. The statistical and texture feature extraction is implemented using Asymmetry, Border, Color, Diameter, (ABCD) and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). The experimental analysis is conduted on ISIC 2019 Challenge dataset consisting of 8 different types of dermoscopic images. For classification purpose, Multi-class Support Vector Machine (MSVM) was implemented and the accuracy obtained is about 96.25.},
